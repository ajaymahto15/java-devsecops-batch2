style of programming
------------------------

 1. imperative programming

 => solving a problem using step-by-step instructions

       -> intention + implementation mixed


 2. declarative programming

    => we say 'what' we want to achieve, not 'how' to achieve it

        -> intention separated from implementation

   How?

   -> by primitive/object parameters
